# rmalias-zsh
this is a simple program i made to help me quickly remove aliases from my .zshrc file in my home directory

this is NOT made for use on other peoples computers though feel free to check the code to see if you can run it if you break anything using or changing this code that is not my fault READ THE CODE FIRST

example: rmalias myalias

this removes any line starting with "alias myalias=" in your .zshrc file in your home directory
